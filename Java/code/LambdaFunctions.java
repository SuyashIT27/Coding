/*1. Shortcuts: Lambda expressions are
quick, nameless functions for small
tasks.
2. Syntax: Written as (parameters)->
{body}, linking inputs to actions.
3. Functional Interfaces: They work
with interfaces that have only one
method, making code concise.
4. Readability: They make code shorter
and clearer, especially with
collections.
5. Useful with Collections: Great for
managing lists and sets, like filtering
or sorting.*/
